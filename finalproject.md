# Final Project 1

## Outline

<b>Setup:</b>
Climate change causes a warmer ocean, which leads to coral expelling the algae that gives them their color and producing their food. 

<b>Conflict:</b>
Without algae, the coral will die, and the entire reef ecosystem that the ocean wildlife depends on will collapse. 

<b>Resolution:</b><br>
Humans need to:<br>
<ul>Prevent warmer ocean temperatures by emitting less carbon dioxide<br>
Sustain coral reef livelihood through monitoring, adaptation, and restoration</ul>

## Data
From my preliminary research I found that the most extensive coral reef bleaching prevention programs are conducted by the US (NOAA) and Australia (Barrier Reef). Additionally, there is a documentary film dedicated specifically to this topic, which is Chasing Coral on Netflix and they have their own website that stores all the related information. Those three websites will be my main sources. I will complement this data with other government/non-government organizations that in a way supports this cause such as NASA, WWF, Climate.gov, and Coral Watch. <br>

## Method and Medium
I will use the tools that are taught in class, which are: <br>
<ul>Shorthand for overall data story platform<br>
Tableau and Flourish for creating charts and graphs<br>
Canva and Photopea for photo editing<br>
Unsplash and Pexels for photo sources<br>
Freepik, Nounproject, Flaticon, Iconfinder for icon and graphic sources<br>
I will use the finished data story on Shorthand for my final presentation.</ul>

## Classroom Critique Result
<b>What Works:</b><br>
<ul>Use of term 'rainforest of the ocean' to describe coral reef<br>
Use of powerful percentage such as '30% people depend on coral reef'</ul>
 
 </b>What Doesn't Work:</b><br>
 <ul>The chart is still not following the order of the storyline<br>
 The call for action is too much, try to narrow it down to prevent overwhelming audience</ul><br>
 
 <b>What Could Be Improved:</b><br>
 <ul>If possible, create timeline as well for the opposite, like projection of what would happen if we take action now</ul>
