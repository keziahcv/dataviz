Data, charts, processes, thoughts. Basically every works I did in the Telling Stories With Data class. 

## About Me
My name is Keziah Cahya Virdayanti but you can call me <b>Keziah.</b> She/Her. Born & raised in Indonesia. A Master of Integrated Innovation for Products & Services (MIIPS) student at Carnegie Mellon University. I studied architecture for my undergrad but I have worked as designer, analyst, engineer, and most recently a UX Researcher (sounds like I did a lot, but not really, they are just my work titles).

## What I Hope To Learn
I love data and i love storytelling, so enrolling in this class is a no-brainer for me. More importantly, with this class I hope to hone my quantitative research skill, so that I can tell future employer that I am a mixed method UX Researcher (please hire me). That, or using data to craft product strategy as a Product Manager. We'll see. I think this knowledge will be useful regardless of the career path I choose. Please don't make me choose now.

The data we are given this week is about Debt to GDP ratio of OEC countries, starting from 1995 to 2021 (however, since the 2021 data is incomplete, i decided to only use data up to 2020). In the original bar chart from OECD website, I chose to highlight the top 3 countries, because this is the story that I want to tell. However, because I can only choose 1 year to present, it is not clear what exactly the message from these top 3 countries data.

Next, I follow the instruction to create spark line chart in Flourish. This is insightful for me because I have never made a grid chart before. The grid chart is advantageous because we can see each country clearly, however, it is hard for user to compare the data of different countries. Due to this, I decided to combine what I think is lacking from the 1st and 2nd chart and adding it onto the 3rd chart. For the 3rd chart, I chose line chart race to create data movements of the top 3 countries over the year. This way, I manage to highlight the top 3 countries, display how their debt change over the years, and compare it with the rest of OECD countries.
