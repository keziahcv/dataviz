# Keziah Does Data
Data, charts, processes, thoughts. Basically every works I did in the Telling Stories With Data class. 

## About Me
My name is Keziah Cahya Virdayanti but you can call me <b>Keziah.</b> She/Her. Born & raised in Indonesia. A Master of Integrated Innovation for Products & Services (MIIPS) student at Carnegie Mellon University. I studied architecture for my undergrad but I have worked as designer, analyst, engineer, and most recently a UX Researcher (sounds like I did a lot, but not really, they are just my work titles).

## What I Hope To Learn
I love data and i love storytelling, so enrolling in this class is a no-brainer for me. More importantly, with this class I hope to hone my quantitative research skill, so that I can tell future employer that I am a mixed method UX Researcher (please hire me). That, or using data to craft product strategy as a Product Manager. We'll see. I think this knowledge will be useful regardless of the career path I choose. Please don't make me choose now.
