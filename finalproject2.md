## Setup
 
A coral is an animal with lots of polyps.
Each polyp is a circular mouth surrounded by tentacles. 
Inside their tissues are plants, microalgae, a million per centimeter square.
These algae photosynthesize and provide food for the coral. It is also what gives the coral their colors.

<b>Data Visualization:</b>
Coral reefs cover only 2% of the ocean bottom (and less than 1% of the earth’s surface),
And yet…

<b>Data Visualization:</b>
Coral reefs support 25% of all known marine species, and the variety of species living on coral reefs is greater than almost anywhere else in the world. 

<b>Data Visualization:</b>
Scientists estimate that more than 1 million species of plants and animals are associated with coral reef ecosystems. 
Coral reefs support approximately 4000 species of fish (Some estimates report the world’s oceans are home to 20,000 species of fish.)
and 800 types of corals.

And that is why they are called the rainforests of the ocean (in fact, coral reefs exceed rainforests in their diversity)

However, it is not only marine life that depends on coral reefs for their livelihood…

<b>Data Visualization:</b>
At least 500 million people rely on coral reefs for food, coastal protection, and livelihoods.
Over 275 million people worldwide live in the direct vicinity of coral reefs (within 30 km of reefs and less than 10 km from the coast), and approximately 850 million people live within 100 km of coral reefs.

<b>Data Visualization:</b>
In developing countries, coral reefs contribute about 25% of the total fish catch, providing food to an estimated 1 billion people in Asia alone. 

<b>Data Visualization:</b>
More than 150,000 km of shoreline in 100 countries and territories receive some protection from reefs.
Coral reefs have been used in the treatment of cancer, HIV, cardiovascular diseases, ulcers, and other ailments.

And more…

<b>Data Visualization:</b>
It is estimated that coral reefs provide $375 billion per year around the world in goods and services.

<b>Data Visualization:</b>
At least 94 countries and territories benefit from reef tourism. In 23 of these, reef tourism accounts for more than 15 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).

<b>Data Visualization:</b>
In one estimate, the total net benefit per year of the world’s coral reefs is $29.8 billion. Tourism and recreation account for $9.6 billion of this amount, coastal protection for $9.0 billion, fisheries for $5.7 billion, and biodiversity for $5.5 billion.

## Conflict

But these coral reefs are facing a major threat…
Coral can tolerate only a relatively narrow temperature range between 73-84 degrees F.
When the water gets too warm, the algae inside the coral release compounds to deal with the heat stress that are harmful to the coral, causing the coral to expel the algae… and lose their color.

Coral Bleaching

An increase in temperature for only 1 C for 4 weeks can cause coral bleaching.
When this rising temperature sustains, the algae won’t come back. 
And the coral dies.

Because of global warming,
This happened on a mass scale.

93% of heat trapped by CO2 is absorbed by the ocean.

We can see that the gaps between bleaching are getting shorter…

<b>Data Visualization:</b>
Just in 2016, 29% of the great barrier reef died. This is equivalent to losing most of the trees in Washington DC, Maine. 

<b>Image:</b>
When the forests are on fire, we fight our hardest to make it stop.
When the coral is dying, where are we?
Just because coral reefs are not our habitat, doesn’t mean it won’t affect us.

If we do nothing, this will happen…

By the 2030s, most coral reefs are projected to experience coral bleaching at least twice per decade, and possibly every year by the 2040s. This frequency would prevent coral recovery between episodes. Without drastic change, coral reefs could disappear by 2100.


## Resolution

But there is still hope…
If we work on it. 

Globally, we need to maintain the world’s temperature by reducing carbon emissions.

At the same time, we have to make effort to protect our coral reefs. 
Restore coral habitat and coastal ecosystems
Promote recovery of degraded coral reefs
Strengthen coral’s tolerance to climate change
Protect by cooling and shading of reefs most at risk

Just imagine what will happen if we succeed…
