## 2: Critique According to Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile

<b>Usefulness: 8</b><br />
I assume that the audience for this data is anyone in the workforce or about to enter the workforce. This chart is potentially useful for that audience because it tells them the highest paying and highest growing job in 2018. 

<b>Completeness: 6</b><br />
The chart has corresponding labels and legends for each data point, so for the data that is presented, the visualization is complete. However, it is not clear why only these 24 jobs are presented, because from the text it seems like they choose 24 jobs just so that it fits the data visualization format of a pyramid. 

<b>Perceptibility: 5</b><br />
For each job there are two pieces of information that this chart conveys: earning and growth. For earning, the perceptibility is quite good because I can easily understand the order of earnings from highest to lowest by the size of the stick figure. However, for growth, the perceptibility is not that good because it took me awhile to understand the growth rate, how they relate to the order (none), and how they relate to the color. 

<b>Truthfulness: 7</b><br />
Since I cannot trace the data source, with the current visualization I would conclude that the visualization is reliable and valid, because every information is presented directly (although not all are easily understandable). The only thing that would make it untruthful is the size variety of the stick figure, with each size represents $30,000 salary range. Reader could misinterpret that the salary for the same stick figure size is similar, when in fact there could be up to $30,000 difference.

<b>Intuitiveness: 4</b><br />
For salary, the visualization is quite intuitive because the job is listed in that order, but using stick figure size to portray the salary amount is not that intuitive because we cannot easily know by the size alone. We have to either check the stick figure legend to know the salary range or read the numbers directly. For growth, the visualization is less intuitive because visually it’s portrayed through colors that are not naturally opposing each other (blue-green). Knowing which color out of the two that are better/worse is not intuitive for reader.

<b>Aesthetics: 8</b><br />
The aesthetic is quite good because it’s enjoyable to look at. The chart is symmetrical, the alignment is in order, the spacing is uniform, and the font variety is minimum with all sans serif font. However, as a chart, the aesthetic is not helping the delivery of the information.

<b>Engagement 9</b><br />
It could possibly lead to high engagement because the topic itself is interesting to talk about. It could even inspire the audience to follow the career path in the chart based on the given information.

## 3 Redesign Sketch

## 4 Feedback for the Redesign Sketch
I asked feedback for the sketch from 4 graduate students (20-30 year old). The feedback I got for the redesign sketch:
<b>Person 1</b>
<ul>The chart is understandable because the salary and job growth is in two different axis</ul>
<ul>The data points are too many and hard to digest, it's better if you can find their trend line</ul>
<ul>The axis should have numbers with appropriate interval</ul>
<b>Person 2</b>
<ul>I can understand the chart easily</ul>
<ul>But the information on job growth is not clear. How many year</ul>
<ul>The axis should have numbers with appropriate interval</ul>
I can understand the chart meaning but 
Little confused by the projected job growth
How many years projected job growth
